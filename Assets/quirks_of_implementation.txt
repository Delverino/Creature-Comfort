Oftentimes in unity a solution will require certain standards to be kept up among other code for it to function properly.
This is documentation of those standards.

Both variables and function names are named with camelCase
    e.g. multiWordFunction or multiWordVariable

Curly braces go on new lines :)
No spaces inside parentheses for loops, conditionals, etc.


"CameraFocus" is a tag only for camera focus points, anything with this tag must have a kinematic rigidbody and a 2d collider
Animals will have the "Animal" tag

Anything which the player can jump from must have the layer "Ground"

When adding the AnimalPanel prefab into a new scene, the OnClick for each button must be set individually to the TransformationManager, and then calling the SelectActiveAnimal method with the correct integer for that button
