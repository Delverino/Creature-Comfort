Oftentimes in unity a solution will require certain standards to be kept up among other code for it to function properly.
This is documentation of those standards.

Both variables and function names are named with camelcase beginning with a capital
    e.g. MultiWordFunction or MultiWordVariable

Curly braces go on new lines :)
No spaces inside parentheses for loops, conditionals, etc.


"CameraFocus" is a tag only for camera focus points, anything with this tag must have a kinematic rigidbody and a 2d collider

Anything which the player can jump from must have the layer "Ground"
